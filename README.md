# Homework-Organizer
This python file allows the user to organize their homeworks by due date.

After adding a name, due date, and class name, the program will organize every homework and display it to the user in order, prioritized by date. The homeworks will be saved onto a text file so that they will not be lost after the program closes and can be accessible later on.
